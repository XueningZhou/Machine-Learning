### Machine-Learning
 I'm learning ML using Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C Muller and Sarah Guido. Every document here contains my notes and code of one corresponding chapter.
In Chapter 1, we used k-Nearest Neighbors model to classify 3 iris species by their quantified traits. Chapter 2 talks about supervised ML algorithms, and 3 talks about unsupervised ML algorithms.
